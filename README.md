# Cypher

Cypher would rather forget. Just like Cypher `cypher` would rather forget all
about your logins, messages and room state. That's why `cypher` is a tiny
stateless client for getting basic metadata from matrix homeservers.

Cypher was scheming. `cypher` will make concurrent requests where possible
just to see which lucks out first.

For Cypher image and experience was all that mattered. `cypher` is intended to
fetch matrix resource previews.

Cypher may have been evil or misguided. `cypher` may not be.

Cypher is a light-weight TS client which will fetch metadata for:
  - rooms
  - users
  - groups
  - events
